How to style a responsive HTML email 
====================================

This is a draft of a guide on how to avoid common gotchas while developing your responsive html emails. It will not account for every trickery that's out there - but just the basics to get you started and avoid the most time consuming bugs.

## What to say when the designer asks

* Can we have a [negative top margin style] element above a template image? -`Nay`
* Can we use this non-standard webfont? -`Nay`
* Can we add a gif? -`Sure - but make sure its ok if it falls back to just the first frame`
* How many articles can I display? -`As many as can fit in 1790px height`
* How wide should the email be? -`Less than 600px. (definitely no more than 800px)`
* Can we add transparent PNGs on top of content? -`Nope`
* Can 


## How to code the email

* tables, tables, tables
* inline styles, default td attributes
* Assets must be cut by line
* Assets that are replaÃ§able by client (in Mailchimp) should not be on over/under-laying other elements
* INK: allows for rapid 12col>1col responsive email layouts


## Making it responsive

* hiding elements
* main, gutter class
* re-ordering elements for mobile


## Client specific issues

* Gmail: No responsive design possible
* Gmail Android: to avoid the "Gmail Responsiveness", add an image the size of the email in the parent table and set its min-width to the email width (i.e. 580px)

* Outlook: Tables must be "breakable" around 1790px or less. Place a `page-break-before: always`  on the element where it would be OK to break (word rendering engine);




bug list
========

* Outlook 2007 and 2010 render HTML through Word Html engine, and therefore all **tables longer than 1790px will cause a line break**. The solution is to add a 'style="page-break-before: always"' on the containing tr element.

* Your {br/} tags now won't work as expected. You will need to **add tables and trs everywhere** you want line breaks.
* Yahoo will render inline ALL your styles EVEN THOUGH it is a media query. A fix for this is to add a random attribute to your body tag and then prepend all your css classes with it. For example \<body yahoo\> > body[yahoo] .someclass {foot:bar;}
* To **hide elements** in Gmail you need to add height=0 and width=0 on your element (display:none is not enough). The oposite is true for other readers (you might need to add "mso-hide:all" on your elements for Outlook 2007-2013 [source: http://www.copernica.com/en/blog/quick-tip-how-to-hide-mobile-content-in-desktop-email-clients]).
* To **hide text** in Gmail, you will have to set the color to "transparent". Also add "overflow:hidden;float:left;" and clear in css.
* To **hide an image** in Outlook 2010/2007 you cannot simply add the styles on the image. You have to wrap the image in a span or other element and hide that span.
* The Gmail app will NOT render any media queries (or anything inside a style element), so **forget about "responsive" emails in Gmail**.
* Don't use half percentage (use plain numbers) on images or HTC android **might** not display them.
* In IOS 6 and Android 4: when you have media queries around an image, the engine might not display the image if you are hiding the image originally (inline styles) - possibly because the two processes of rendering the css are running simultaniously, and only the last one to finish (the slowest) wins. Anyway, add a minimum width in pixels to fix that.
* Gmail app for Android will fuck up your display if your email is wider than [320?]px.
* Gmail will cut your html and add a "show more" button if your html is longer than **~100k characters**
